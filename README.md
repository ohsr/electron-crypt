## ElectronCrypt

>Simple Electron Application which allows to encrypt data in a json file
This JSON File could be used as a real database with electron-store.

No FrontEnd or real project here. Just a Backend CRUD who can work with all projects like a template.

To work directly from this repo:
- `git clone` the project
- Remove **.git** folder with `rm -r .git`
- `npm install` (maybe do it as root due to electron librairy issues)
- `npm start` and check your terminal
